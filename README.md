# App Hub
Easily create app hubs for a plethora of websites and allow users to install them via the browser!

## Getting Started
Download the `template` directory. Change the content of the tabs (we recommend using iFrames), change the branding, update the `app.webmanifest` code, and deploy your app hub!
